refactor: unify aggregateCoreEvents into shared module

Consolidated duplicate aggregateCoreEvents functions from bot.ts and SchedulerService.ts into a single shared module with smart deduplication logic.

Key changes:
- Created src/utils/eventAggregation.ts with unified aggregation logic
- Implemented smart deduplication with priority-based selection:
  * Prefers events with actual/forecast data
  * Prefers High impact over Medium/Low
  * Prefers ForexFactory as more reliable source (when quality is equal)
- Updated all 9 call sites across bot.ts and SchedulerService.ts
- Added detailed logging for deduplication process
- Removed 142 lines of duplicate code

Resolves #3 from DATA_QUALITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
